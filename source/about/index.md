# About Me

Hey! Welcome to my personal space, where I occasionally post random stuff:) Currently, I'm a worker at Microsoft. Before that, I worked as an engineer at Flexport and later at Paulson Institute's think tank, MacroPolo, where I conducted research on geopolitics and trade. I graduated from University of Michigan in 2022 where I studied Computer Science.
