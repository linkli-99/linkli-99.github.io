# About Me

Hey! Welcome to Linkai's personal space. I'm currently a worker at Microsoft. Before that, I've worked in both Flexport on customs automation and Paulson Institute's digital think tank, MacroPolo, on de-globalization research. I graduated from University of Michigan in 2022 where I studied Computer Science.
