# About Me

Hey! Welcome to Linkai's personal space. I'm currently a worker at Microsoft. Before that, I worked on customs tech at Flexport, and later conducted reserach on de-globalization trend at Paulson Institute's think tank. I graduated from University of Michigan in 2022 where I studied Computer Science.
