# About Me

Hi! I'm Linkai. I'm currently conducting research at the Paulson Institute's think tank, MacroPolo. I previously worked as a SWE at Flexport after graduating from University of Michigan.

In my freetime, I love reading, traveling to novel places, and doing landscape photography. I know little bit of Russian and am currently working on improving my Japanese.
